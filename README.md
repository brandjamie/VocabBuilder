# VocabBuilder
VocabBuilder is an android app to practice vocabulary for foreign language learners. The app was originally created to help prefoundation students at the University of Nizwa to practice weekly vocabulary lists for the Fall 2016 cycle. The program offers students the choice of practicing daily or weekly wordlists or the accumulated vocabulary learned over the duration of the course. 
Transliteration of Arabic words is offered should any English speakers wish to study the words.

The app was listed on the Play store as 'Unizwa Vocab Pre Foundation' but has now been unpublished as it contains vocab relevent only to that semester. The app can be adapted by changing the wordlist in 'fall(a)vocab.csv' in the assets folder as well as changing the dates of each unit of vocab to be introduced in the 'weekstarts' array in 'MainActivity.java'. 

This code is offered with an MIT licence.
